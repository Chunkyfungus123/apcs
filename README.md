# AP-Computer Science

Here are the stuffs I did for my AP-CS class of year 2021-2022 at the school of GNSHS.

**Remember, don't copy my code if you get the same project. Please read the license for further details.**

**COPYING MY CODE WON'T HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING USE IT AT YOUR OWN COST!!!! I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITIES (See License)**

All code are licenses and protected by the license see [here](./LICENSE.md). Please read this in order to better understand how things work.

### Files
For each project and assignment, the code and assignment details would be put into a seperate folder.

Check in the folder `/src/`. Folders besides this folder should be ignored unless you are running this entire repo.

### Notice

This repo is only for resources and not to teach you anything directly.

### Code Quality

If I have a current assignment, I will not put it on this REPO before it is due!
