Here are the stuffs I did for my AP-CS class of year 2021-2022 at the school of GNSHS.

**Remember, don't copy my code if you get the same project. Please read the license for further details.**

**COPYING MY CODE WON'T HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING USE IT AT YOUR OWN COST!!!! I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITIES (See License)**

All code are licenses and protected by the license see [here](./LICENSE.md). Please read this in order to better understand how things work.

### Files
For each project and assignment, the code and assignment details would be put into a seperate folder.

Check in the folder `/resource/`. Folders besides this folder should be ignored unless you are running this entire repo.

Check [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for more info on how I am gonna make this repository more usable :)

For files related to the dax program please check the branch `dax-program`

The file [LATEST](./LATEST) will provide you all the current assignments and projects that is ongoing or is recent. Use it to view the status of this repository 

### Dax Program

I created this program so you could easily find anything you are looking for without having to look through this master branch manually. Just run the program and yea :).


### Notice

This repo is only for resources and not to teach you anything directly.

### Code Quality

If I have a current assignment, I will not put it on this REPO before it is due!

There is a Codacy Badge above that will show this branch's Code quality and Grade, with `A` being the best, etc..

Some workflows to improve Code Quality are the following Workflows: `Prettier, Codacy, Discord Webhook`

### Gradle Wrapper
