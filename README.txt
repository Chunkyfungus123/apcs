Dax Program

This is a simple program that will have all of the assignments and source code bundled in with it. However, this isn't your "zip" file as you would download it
straight from the repository. Instead, this is a much more user friendly setup :)

This is a work in progress, usability documentations will arrive later.

After the course is over and I have written the last of the code, I will post all my work and solutions here. Then I will tie those code in with this program and I would
hope it would work, and then you should check in the releases tab of this GitHub repository or check in the folder: "Downloads"

See License.txt for more information.
Note: this license applies to the totality of this repository, this means source code within may also have differing licenses according to their specific owners.

Notice: This branch is to never be PR into master as these two branches are separate entities
